An AI-powered assistant for discovering Software Design Patterns through semantic search.

# PatternPedia: Your AI Design Pattern Advisor

## 1. The Problem

Software design patterns are fundamental concepts, but learning and applying them is challenging for many developers. Traditional keyword-based search fails when a developer can describe a design problem but doesn't know the name of the corresponding pattern. For example, searching "how to let objects communicate without knowing each other" won't easily lead to the Observer or Mediator patterns.

## 2. Our Solution

PatternPedia is a semantic search engine for the world of design patterns. Instead of keywords, you can describe your architectural problem in natural language. The system uses AI (specifically, text embeddings) to understand the _meaning_ behind your query and retrieves the most relevant design patterns from a knowledge base built from Refactoring.Guru. It aims to bridge the gap between problem description and solution discovery.
