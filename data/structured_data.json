It can handle lazy initialization and result caching without the client or the real database object even knowing. But what’s the benefit?

The proxy must follow this interface to be able to disguise itself as a service object. The Service is a class that provides some useful business logic. The Proxy class has a reference field that points to a service object. After the proxy finishes its processing (e.g., lazy initialization, logging, access control, caching, etc.), it passes the request to the service object. Usually, proxies manage the full lifecycle of their service objects. The Client should work with both services and proxies via the same interface.

Let’s go over the most popular uses. Lazy initialization (virtual proxy). This is when you have a heavyweight service object that wastes system resources by being always up, even though you only need it from time to time. Instead of creating the object when the app launches, you can delay the object’s initialization to a time when it’s really needed. Access control (protection proxy). This is when you want only specific clients to be able to use the service object; for instance, when your objects are crucial parts of an operating system and clients are various launched applications (including malicious ones). The proxy can pass the request to the service object only if the client’s credentials match some criteria. Local execution of a remote service (remote proxy). This is when the service object is located on a remote server. In this case, the proxy passes the client request over the network, handling all of the nasty details of working with the network. Logging requests (logging proxy). This is when you want to keep a history of requests to the service object. The proxy can log each request before passing it to the service. Caching request results (caching proxy). This is when you need to cache results of client requests and manage the life cycle of this cache, especially if results are quite large. The proxy can implement caching for recurring requests that always yield the same results. The proxy may use the parameters of requests as the cache keys. Smart reference. This is when you need to be able to dismiss a heavyweight object once there are no clients that use it. The proxy can keep track of clients that obtained a reference to the service object or its results. From time to time, the proxy may go over the clients and check whether they are still active. If the client list gets empty, the proxy might dismiss the service object and free the underlying system resources. The proxy can also track whether the client had modified the service object. Then the unchanged objects may be reused by other clients.", "how_to_implement": ["If there’s no pre-existing service interface, create one to make proxy and service objects interchangeable.

{"name": "Flyweight", "url": "https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight", "category": "Structural patterns", "intent": "Intent Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.", "problem": "Problem To have some fun after long working hours, you decided to create a simple video game: players would be moving around a map and shooting each other. You chose to implement a realistic particle system and make it a distinctive feature of the game. Vast quantities of bullets, missiles, and shrapnel from explosions should fly all over the map and deliver a thrilling experience to the player. Upon its completion, you pushed the last commit, built the game and sent it to your friend for a test drive. Although the game was running flawlessly on your machine, your friend wasn’t able to play for long. On his computer, the game kept crashing after a few minutes of gameplay. After spending several hours digging through debug logs, you discovered that the game crashed because of an insufficient amount of RAM. It turned out that your friend’s rig was much less powerful than your own computer, and that’s why the problem emerged so quickly on his machine. The actual problem was related to your particle system. Each particle, such as a bullet, a missile or a piece of shrapnel was represented by a separate object containing plenty of data. At some point, when the carnage on a player’s screen reached its climax, newly created particles no longer fit into the remaining RAM, so the program crashed.", "solution": "Solution On closer inspection of the Particle class, you may notice that the color and sprite fields consume a lot more memory than other fields. What’s worse is that these two fields store almost identical data across all particles. For example, all bullets have the same color and sprite. Other parts of a particle’s state, such as coordinates, movement vector and speed, are unique to each particle. After all, the values of these fields change over time. This data represents the always changing context in which the particle exists, while the color and sprite remain constant for each particle. This constant data of an object is usually called the intrinsic state . It lives within the object; other objects can only read it, not change it. The rest of the object’s state, often altered “from the outside” by other objects, is called the extrinsic state . The Flyweight pattern suggests that you stop storing the extrinsic state inside the object. Instead, you should pass this state to specific methods which rely on it. Only the intrinsic state stays within the object, letting you reuse it in different contexts. As a result, you’d need fewer of these objects since they only differ in the intrinsic state, which has much fewer variations than the extrinsic. Let’s return to our game. Assuming that we had extracted the extrinsic state from our particle class, only three different objects would suffice to represent all particles in the game: a bullet, a missile, and a piece of shrapnel. As you’ve probably guessed by now, an object that only stores the intrinsic state is called a flyweight . Extrinsic state storage Where does the extrinsic state move to? Some class should still store it, right? In most cases, it gets moved to the container object, which aggregates objects before we apply the pattern. In our case, that’s the main Game object that stores all particles in the particles field. To move the extrinsic state into this class, you need to create several array fields for storing coordinates, vectors, and speed of each individual particle. But that’s not all. You need another array for storing references to a specific flyweight that represents a particle. These arrays must be in sync so that you can access all data of a particle using the same index. A more elegant solution is to create a separate context class that would store the extrinsic state along with reference to the flyweight object. This approach would require having just a single array in the container class. Wait a second! Won’t we need to have as many of these contextual objects as we had at the very beginning? Technically, yes. But the thing is, these objects are much smaller than before. The most memory-consuming fields have been moved to just a few flyweight objects. Now, a thousand small contextual objects can reuse a single heavy flyweight object instead of storing a thousand copies of its data. Flyweight and immutability Since the same flyweight object can be used in different contexts, you have to make sure that its state can’t be modified. A flyweight should initialize its state just once, via constructor parameters. It shouldn’t expose any setters or public fields to other objects. Flyweight factory For more convenient access to various flyweights, you can create a factory method that manages a pool of existing flyweight objects. The method accepts the intrinsic state of the desired flyweight from a client, looks for an existing flyweight object matching this state, and returns it if it was found. If not, it creates a new flyweight and adds it to the pool. There are several options where this method could be placed. The most obvious place is a flyweight container. Alternatively, you could create a new factory class. Or you could make the factory method static and put it inside an actual flyweight class.", "structure_text": "The Flyweight pattern is merely an optimization. Before applying it, make sure your program does have the RAM consumption problem related to having a massive number of similar objects in memory at the same time. Make sure that this problem can’t be solved in any other meaningful way. The Flyweight class contains the portion of the original object’s state that can be shared between multiple objects. The same flyweight object can be used in many different contexts. The state stored inside a flyweight is called intrinsic. The state passed to the flyweight’s methods is called extrinsic. The Context class contains the extrinsic state, unique across all original objects. When a context is paired with one of the flyweight objects, it represents the full state of the original object. Usually, the behavior of the original object remains in the flyweight class. In this case, whoever calls a flyweight’s method must also pass appropriate bits of the extrinsic state into the method’s parameters. On the other hand, the behavior can be moved to the context class, which would use the linked flyweight merely as a data object. The Client calculates or stores the extrinsic state of flyweights. From the client’s perspective, a flyweight is a template object which can be configured at runtime by passing some contextual data into parameters of its methods. The Flyweight Factory manages a pool of existing flyweights. With the factory, clients don’t create flyweights directly. Instead, they call the factory, passing it bits of the intrinsic state of the desired flyweight. The factory looks over previously created flyweights and either returns an existing one that matches search criteria or creates a new one if nothing is found. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 740px; } .struct-image1 { left: 210px; top: 160px; } .struct-li1 { left: 50px; top: 10px; width: 400px; } .struct-li2 { left: 0px; top: 570px; width: 270px; } .struct-li3 { left: 310px; top: 570px; width: 190px; } .struct-li4 { left: 540px; top: 570px; width: 300px; } .struct-li5 { left: 510px; top: 10px; width: 350px; } .struct-li6 { left: 0px; top: 170px; width: 200px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode In this example, the Flyweight pattern helps to reduce memory usage when rendering millions of tree objects on a canvas.

The initial version of the library was based on the Notifier class that had only a few fields, a constructor and a single send method. The method could accept a message argument from a client and send the message to a list of emails that were passed to the notifier via its constructor. A third-party app which acted as a client was supposed to create and configure the notifier object once, and then use it each time something important happened. A program could use the notifier class to send notifications about important events to a predefined set of emails. At some point, you realize that users of the library expect more than just email notifications. Many of them would like to receive an SMS about critical issues. Others would like to be notified on Facebook and, of course, the corporate users would love to get Slack notifications. Each notification type is implemented as a notifier’s subclass. How hard can that be? You extended the Notifier class and put the additional notification methods into new subclasses. Now the client was supposed to instantiate the desired notification class and use it for all further notifications. But then someone reasonably asked you, “Why can’t you use several notification types at once? If your house is on fire, you’d probably want to be informed through every channel.” You tried to address that problem by creating special subclasses which combined several notification methods within one class.

You have to find some other way to structure notifications classes so that their number won’t accidentally break some Guinness record.", "solution": "Solution Extending a class is the first thing that comes to mind when you need to alter an object’s behavior. However, inheritance has several serious caveats that you need to be aware of. Inheritance is static. You can’t alter the behavior of an existing object at runtime. You can only replace the whole object with another one that’s created from a different subclass. Subclasses can have just one parent class. In most languages, inheritance doesn’t let a class inherit behaviors of multiple classes at the same time. One of the ways to overcome these caveats is by using Aggregation or Composition Aggregation : object A contains objects B; B can live without A. Composition : object A consists of objects B; A manages life cycle of B; B can’t live without A. instead of Inheritance . Both of the alternatives work almost the same way: one object has a reference to another and delegates it some work, whereas with inheritance, the object itself is able to do that work, inheriting the behavior from its superclass. With this new approach you can easily substitute the linked “helper” object with another, changing the behavior of the container at runtime. An object can use the behavior of various classes, having references to multiple objects and delegating them all kinds of work. Aggregation/composition is the key principle behind many design patterns, including Decorator. On that note, let’s return to the pattern discussion. Inheritance vs. Aggregation “Wrapper” is the alternative nickname for the Decorator pattern that clearly expresses the main idea of the pattern. A wrapper is an object that can be linked with some target object. The wrapper contains the same set of methods as the target and delegates to it all requests it receives. However, the wrapper may alter the result by doing something either before or after it passes the request to the target. When does a simple wrapper become the real decorator? As I mentioned, the wrapper implements the same interface as the wrapped object. That’s why from the client’s perspective these objects are identical. Make the wrapper’s reference field accept any object that follows that interface. This will let you cover an object in multiple wrappers, adding the combined behavior of all the wrappers to it. In our notifications example, let’s leave the simple email notification behavior inside the base Notifier class, but turn all other notification methods into decorators. Various notification methods become decorators. The client code would need to wrap a basic notifier object into a set of decorators that match the client’s preferences. The resulting objects will be structured as a stack. Apps might configure complex stacks of notification decorators. The last decorator in the stack would be the object that the client actually works with. Since all decorators implement the same interface as the base notifier, the rest of the client code won’t care whether it works with the “pure” notifier object or the decorated one. We could apply the same approach to other behaviors such as formatting messages or composing the recipient list. The client can decorate the object with any custom decorators, as long as they follow the same interface as the others.", "structure_text": "The Component declares the common interface for both wrappers and wrapped objects. Concrete Component is a class of objects being wrapped. It defines the basic behavior, which can be altered by decorators. The Base Decorator class has a field for referencing a wrapped object. The field’s type should be declared as the component interface so it can contain both concrete components and decorators. The base decorator delegates all operations to the wrapped object. Concrete Decorators define extra behaviors that can be added to components dynamically. Concrete decorators override methods of the base decorator and execute their behavior either before or after calling the parent method. The Client can wrap components in multiple layers of decorators, as long as it works with all objects via the component interface. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 540px; } .struct-image1 { left: 200px; top: 10px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 70px; width: 190px; } .struct-li2 { left: 0px; top: 210px; width: 190px; } .struct-li3 { left: 690px; top: 190px; width: 230px; } .struct-li4 { left: 40px; top: 380px; width: 320px; } .struct-li5 { left: 610px; top: 20px; width: 310px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode In this example, the Decorator pattern lets you compress and encrypt sensitive data independently from the code that actually uses this data.

For example, imagine that you have two types of objects: Products and Boxes . A Box can contain several Products as well as a number of smaller Boxes . These little Boxes can also hold some Products or even smaller Boxes , and so on. Say you decide to create an ordering system that uses these classes. Orders could contain simple products without any wrapping, as well as boxes stuffed with products...and other boxes. How would you determine the total price of such an order? An order might comprise various products, packaged in boxes, which are packaged in bigger boxes and so on. The whole structure looks like an upside down tree. You could try the direct approach: unwrap all the boxes, go over all the products and then calculate the total. That would be doable in the real world; but in a program, it’s not as simple as running a loop. You have to know the classes of Products and Boxes you’re going through, the nesting level of the boxes and other nasty details beforehand. All of this makes the direct approach either too awkward or even impossible.", "solution": "Solution The Composite pattern suggests that you work with Products and Boxes through a common interface which declares a method for calculating the total price. How would this method work? For a product, it’d simply return the product’s price. For a box, it’d go over each item the box contains, ask its price and then return a total for this box. If one of these items were a smaller box, that box would also start going over its contents and so on, until the prices of all inner components were calculated. A box could even add some extra cost to the final price, such as packaging cost. The Composite pattern lets you run a behavior recursively over all components of an object tree. The greatest benefit of this approach is that you don’t need to care about the concrete classes of objects that compose the tree. You don’t need to know whether an object is a simple product or a sophisticated box. You can treat them all the same via the common interface.

The Leaf is a basic element of a tree that doesn’t have sub-elements. Usually, leaf components end up doing most of the real work, since they don’t have anyone to delegate the work to. The Container (aka composite ) is an element that has sub-elements: leaves or other containers. A container doesn’t know the concrete classes of its children. It works with all sub-elements only via the component interface. Upon receiving a request, a container delegates the work to its sub-elements, processes intermediate results and then returns the final result to the client.

Implementation? Sound scary? Stay calm and let’s consider a simple example. Say you have a geometric Shape class with a pair of subclasses: Circle and Square . You want to extend this class hierarchy to incorporate colors, so you plan to create Red and Blue shape subclasses. However, since you already have two subclasses, you’ll need to create four class combinations such as BlueCircle and RedSquare . Number of class combinations grows in geometric progression. Adding new shape types and colors to the hierarchy will grow it exponentially. For example, to add a triangle shape you’d need to introduce two subclasses, one for each color. And after that, adding a new color would require creating three subclasses, one for each shape type. The further we go, the worse it becomes.", "solution": "Solution This problem occurs because we’re trying to extend the shape classes in two independent dimensions: by form and by color. That’s a very common issue with class inheritance. The Bridge pattern attempts to solve this problem by switching from inheritance to the object composition. What this means is that you extract one of the dimensions into a separate class hierarchy, so that the original classes will reference an object of the new hierarchy, instead of having all of its state and behaviors within one class. You can prevent the explosion of a class hierarchy by transforming it into several related hierarchies. Following this approach, we can extract the color-related code into its own class with two subclasses: Red and Blue . The Shape class then gets a reference field pointing to one of the color objects. Now the shape can delegate any color-related work to the linked color object. That reference will act as a bridge between the Shape and Color classes. From now on, adding new colors won’t require changing the shape hierarchy, and vice versa. Abstraction and Implementation The GoF book “Gang of Four” is a nickname given to the four authors of the original book about design patterns: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software https://refactoring.guru/gof-book . introduces the terms Abstraction and Implementation as part of the Bridge definition. In my opinion, the terms sound too academic and make the pattern seem more complicated than it really is. Having read the simple example with shapes and colors, let’s decipher the meaning behind the GoF book’s scary words. Abstraction (also called interface ) is a high-level control layer for some entity. This layer isn’t supposed to do any real work on its own. It should delegate the work to the implementation layer (also called platform ). Note that we’re not talking about interfaces or abstract classes from your programming language. These aren’t the same things. When talking about real applications, the abstraction can be represented by a graphical user interface (GUI), and the implementation could be the underlying operating system code (API) which the GUI layer calls in response to user interactions. Generally speaking, you can extend such an app in two independent directions: Have several different GUIs (for instance, tailored for regular customers or admins). Support several different APIs (for example, to be able to launch the app under Windows, Linux, and macOS). In a worst-case scenario, this app might look like a giant spaghetti bowl, where hundreds of conditionals connect different types of GUI with various APIs all over the code. Making even a simple change to a monolithic codebase is pretty hard because you must understand the entire thing very well. Making changes to smaller, well-defined modules is much easier. You can bring order to this chaos by extracting the code related to specific interface-platform combinations into separate classes. However, soon you’ll discover that there are lots of these classes. The class hierarchy will grow exponentially because adding a new GUI or supporting a different API would require creating more and more classes. Let’s try to solve this issue with the Bridge pattern. It suggests that we divide the classes into two hierarchies: Abstraction: the GUI layer of the app. Implementation: the operating systems’ APIs. One of the ways to structure a cross-platform application. The abstraction object controls the appearance of the app, delegating the actual work to the linked implementation object. Different implementations are interchangeable as long as they follow a common interface, enabling the same GUI to work under Windows and Linux. As a result, you can change the GUI classes without touching the API-related classes. Moreover, adding support for another operating system only requires creating a subclass in the implementation hierarchy.", "structure_text": "The Abstraction provides high-level control logic. It relies on the implementation object to do the actual low-level work. The Implementation declares the interface that’s common for all concrete implementations. An abstraction can only communicate with an implementation object via methods that are declared here. The abstraction may list the same methods as the implementation, but usually the abstraction declares some complex behaviors that rely on a wide variety of primitive operations declared by the implementation. Concrete Implementations contain platform-specific code. Refined Abstractions provide variants of control logic. Like their parent, they work with different implementations via the general implementation interface. Usually, the Client is only interested in working with the abstraction. However, it’s the client’s job to link the abstraction object with one of the implementation objects. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 620px; } .struct-image1 { left: 60px; top: 130px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 90px; width: 170px; } .struct-li2 { left: 640px; top: 50px; width: 190px; } .struct-li3 { left: 420px; top: 480px; width: 220px; } .struct-li4 { left: 110px; top: 520px; width: 280px; } .struct-li5 { left: 200px; top: 30px; width: 390px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode This example illustrates how the Bridge pattern can help divide the monolithic code of an app that manages devices and their remote controls.

All remotes work with the devices via the general device interface, which lets the same remote support multiple device types. You can develop the remote control classes independently from the device classes. All that’s needed is to create a new remote subclass. For example, a basic remote control might only have two buttons, but you could extend it with additional features, such as an extra battery or a touchscreen. The client code links the desired type of remote control with a specific device object via the remote’s constructor. // The \"abstraction\" defines the interface for the \"control\" // part of the two class hierarchies.

This approach simplifies code maintenance and minimizes the risk of breaking existing code. Use the pattern when you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart 3rd-party analytics library. But there’s a catch: the analytics library only works with data in JSON format. You can’t use the analytics library “as is” because it expects the data in a format that’s incompatible with your app. You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not have access to the library’s source code in the first place, making this approach impossible.", "solution": "Solution You can create an adapter . This is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it. An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn’t even aware of the adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial units such as feet and miles. Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also help objects with different interfaces collaborate. Here’s how it works: The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing objects. Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the adapter’s methods. Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second object, but in a format and order that the second object expects. Sometimes it’s even possible to create a two-way adapter that can convert the calls in both directions. Let’s get back to our stock market app. To solve the dilemma of incompatible formats, you can create XML-to-JSON adapters for every class of the analytics library that your code works with directly. Then you adjust your code to communicate with the library only via these adapters. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming XML data into a JSON structure and passes the call to the appropriate methods of a wrapped analytics object.", "structure_text": "Object adapter This implementation uses the object composition principle: the adapter implements the interface of one object and wraps the other one. It can be implemented in all popular programming languages. The Client is a class that contains the existing business logic of the program. The Client Interface describes a protocol that other classes must follow to be able to collaborate with the client code. The Service is some useful class (usually 3rd-party or legacy). The client can’t use this class directly because it has an incompatible interface. The Adapter is a class that’s able to work with both the client and the service: it implements the client interface, while wrapping the service object. The adapter receives calls from the client via the client interface and translates them into calls to the wrapped service object in a format it can understand. The client code doesn’t get coupled to the concrete adapter class as long as it works with the adapter via the client interface. Thanks to this, you can introduce new types of adapters into the program without breaking the existing client code. This can be useful when the interface of the service class gets changed or replaced: you can just create a new adapter class without changing the client code. Class adapter This implementation uses inheritance: the adapter inherits interfaces from both objects at the same time. Note that this approach can only be implemented in programming languages that support multiple inheritance, such as C++. The Class Adapter doesn’t need to wrap any objects because it inherits behaviors from both the client and the service. The adaptation happens within the overridden methods. The resulting adapter can be used in place of an existing client class. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 1240px; } .adapter-object { height: 590px; } .adapter-class { height: 300px; } .struct-image1 { left: 160px; top: 270px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 230px; width: 160px; } .struct-li2 { left: 230px; top: 150px; width: 230px; } .struct-li3 { left: 510px; top: 270px; width: 220px; } .struct-li4 { left: 260px; top: 600px; width: 420px; } .struct-li5 { left: 0px; top: 390px; width: 230px; } .struct-image2 { left: 100px; top: 920px; } .struct-li6 { left: 0px; top: 1020px; width: 230px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode This example of the Adapter pattern is based on the classic conflict between square pegs and round holes.

Why would anyone want to control how many instances a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resource—for example, a database or a file. Here’s how it works: imagine that you created an object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created. Note that this behavior is impossible to implement with a regular constructor since a constructor call must always return a new object by design. Clients may not even realize that they’re working with the same object all the time. Provide a global access point to that instance . Remember those global variables that you (all right, me) used to store some essential objects? While they’re very handy, they’re also very unsafe since any code can potentially overwrite the contents of those variables and crash the app. Just like a global variable, the Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance from being overwritten by other code. There’s another side to this problem: you don’t want the code that solves problem #1 to be scattered all over your program.

Since you have to know the object’s class to create a duplicate, your code becomes dependent on that class. If the extra dependency doesn’t scare you, there’s another catch.

The method creates an object of the current class and carries over all of the field values of the old object into the new one. You can even copy private fields because most programming languages let objects access private fields of other objects that belong to the same class. An object that supports cloning is called a prototype . When your objects have dozens of fields and hundreds of possible configurations, cloning them might serve as an alternative to subclassing.

The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.", "problem": "Problem Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. Or even worse: scattered all over the client code. You might make the program too complex by creating a subclass for every possible configuration of an object. For example, let’s think about how to create a House object. To build a simple house, you need to construct four walls and a floor, install a door, fit a pair of windows, and build a roof. But what if you want a bigger, brighter house, with a backyard and other goodies (like a heating system, plumbing, and electrical wiring)? The simplest solution is to extend the base House class and create a set of subclasses to cover all combinations of the parameters. But eventually you’ll end up with a considerable number of subclasses. Any new parameter, such as the porch style, will require growing this hierarchy even more. There’s another approach that doesn’t involve breeding subclasses. You can create a giant constructor right in the base House class with all possible parameters that control the house object. While this approach indeed eliminates the need for subclasses, it creates another problem. The constructor with lots of parameters has its downside: not all the parameters are needed at all times. In most cases most of the parameters will be unused, making the constructor calls pretty ugly . For instance, only a fraction of houses have swimming pools, so the parameters related to swimming pools will be useless nine times out of ten.", "solution": "Solution The Builder pattern suggests that you extract the object construction code out of its own class and move it to separate objects called builders . The Builder pattern lets you construct complex objects step by step. The Builder doesn’t allow other objects to access the product while it’s being built. The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps ( buildWalls , buildDoor , etc.). To create an object, you execute a series of these steps on a builder object. The important part is that you don’t need to call all of the steps. You can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object. Some of the construction steps might require different implementation when you need to build various representations of the product. For example, walls of a cabin may be built of wood, but the castle walls must be built with stone. In this case, you can create several different builder classes that implement the same set of building steps, but in a different manner. Then you can use these builders in the construction process (i.e., an ordered set of calls to the building steps) to produce different kinds of objects. Different builders execute the same task in various ways. For example, imagine a builder that builds everything from wood and glass, a second one that builds everything with stone and iron and a third one that uses gold and diamonds. By calling the same set of steps, you get a regular house from the first builder, a small castle from the second and a palace from the third. However, this would only work if the client code that calls the building steps is able to interact with builders using a common interface. Director You can go further and extract a series of calls to the builder steps you use to construct a product into a separate class called director . The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps. The director knows which building steps to execute to get a working product. Having a director class in your program isn’t strictly necessary. You can always call the building steps in a specific order directly from the client code. However, the director class might be a good place to put various construction routines so you can reuse them across your program.

Concrete Builders provide different implementations of the construction steps. Concrete builders may produce products that don’t follow the common interface. Products are resulting objects. Products constructed by different builders don’t have to belong to the same class hierarchy or interface. The Director class defines the order in which to call construction steps, so you can create and reuse specific configurations of products. The Client must associate one of the builder objects with the director. Usually, it’s done just once, via parameters of the director’s constructor.

The example of step-by-step construction of cars and the user guides that fit those car models. A car is a complex object that can be constructed in a hundred different ways. Instead of bloating the Car class with a huge constructor, we extracted the car assembly code into a separate car builder class. This class has a set of methods for configuring various parts of a car. If the client code needs to assemble a special, fine-tuned model of a car, it can work with the builder directly. On the other hand, the client can delegate the assembly to the director class, which knows how to use a builder to construct several of the most popular models of cars. You might be shocked, but every car needs a manual (seriously, who reads them?). The manual describes every feature of the car, so the details in the manuals vary across the different models. That’s why it makes sense to reuse an existing construction process for both real cars and their respective manuals. Of course, building a manual isn’t the same as building a car, and that’s why we must provide another builder class that specializes in composing manuals. This class implements the same building methods as its car-building sibling, but instead of crafting car parts, it describes them. By passing these builders to the same director object, we can construct either a car or a manual. The final part is fetching the resulting object. A metal car and a paper manual, although related, are still very different things. We can’t place a method for fetching results in the director without coupling the director to concrete product classes. Hence, we obtain the result of the construction from the builder which performed the job. // Using the Builder pattern makes sense only when your products // are quite complex and require extensive configuration. The // following two products are related, although they don't have // a common interface. class Car is // A car can have a GPS, trip computer and some number of // seats.

The Builder pattern can be applied when construction of various representations of the product involves similar steps that differ only in the details. The base builder interface defines all possible construction steps, and concrete builders implement these steps to construct particular representations of the product. Meanwhile, the director class guides the order of construction. Use the Builder to construct Composite trees or other complex objects. The Builder pattern lets you construct products step-by-step.

Your code consists of classes that represent: A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable . Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern , Victorian , ArtDeco . Product families and their variants. You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite mad when they receive non-matching furniture. A Modern-style sofa doesn’t match Victorian-style chairs. Also, you don’t want to change existing code when adding new products or families of products to the program. Furniture vendors update their catalogs very often, and you wouldn’t want to change the core code each time it happens.", "solution": "Solution The first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product family (e.g., chair, sofa or coffee table). Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all chair variants can implement the Chair interface; all coffee table variants can implement the CoffeeTable interface, and so on. All variants of the same object must be moved to a single class hierarchy. The next move is to declare the Abstract Factory —an interface with a list of creation methods for all products that are part of the product family (for example, createChair , createSofa and createCoffeeTable ). These methods must return abstract product types represented by the interfaces we extracted previously: Chair , Sofa , CoffeeTable and so on. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific product variant. Now, how about the product variants? For each variant of a product family, we create a separate factory class based on the AbstractFactory interface. A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind. For example, the ModernFurnitureFactory can only create ModernChair , ModernSofa and ModernCoffeeTable objects. The client code has to work with both factories and products via their respective abstract interfaces. This lets you change the type of a factory that you pass to the client code, as well as the product variant that the client code receives, without breaking the actual client code. The client shouldn’t care about the concrete class of the factory it works with. Say the client wants a factory to produce a chair. The client doesn’t have to be aware of the factory’s class, nor does it matter what kind of chair it gets. Whether it’s a Modern model or a Victorian-style chair, the client must treat all chairs in the same manner, using the abstract Chair interface. With this approach, the only thing that the client knows about the chair is that it implements the sitOn method in some way. Also, whichever variant of the chair is returned, it’ll always match the type of sofa or coffee table produced by the same factory object. There’s one more thing left to clarify: if the client is only exposed to the abstract interfaces, what creates the actual factory objects? Usually, the application creates a concrete factory object at the initialization stage. Just before that, the app must select the factory type depending on the configuration or the environment settings.", "structure_text": "Abstract Products declare interfaces for a set of distinct but related products which make up a product family. Concrete Products are various implementations of abstract products, grouped by variants. Each abstract product (chair/sofa) must be implemented in all given variants (Victorian/Modern). The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of methods for creating each of the abstract products. Concrete Factories implement creation methods of the abstract factory. Each concrete factory corresponds to a specific variant of products and creates only those product variants. Although concrete factories instantiate concrete products, signatures of their creation methods must return corresponding abstract products. This way the client code that uses a factory doesn’t get coupled to the specific variant of the product it gets from a factory. The Client can work with any concrete factory/product variant, as long as it communicates with their objects via abstract interfaces. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 620px; } .struct-image1 { left: 160px; top: 30px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 160px; width: 150px; } .struct-li2 { left: 0px; top: 10px; width: 350px; } .struct-li3 { left: 630px; top: 40px; width: 210px; } .struct-li4 { left: 10px; top: 500px; width: 310px; } .struct-li5 { left: 340px; top: 500px; width: 530px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode This example illustrates how the Abstract Factory pattern can be used for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the client code to concrete UI classes, while keeping all created elements consistent with a selected operating system. The cross-platform UI classes example. The same UI elements in a cross-platform application are expected to behave similarly, but look a little bit different under different operating systems. Moreover, it’s your job to make sure that the UI elements match the style of the current operating system. You wouldn’t want your program to render macOS controls when it’s executed in Windows. The Abstract Factory interface declares a set of creation methods that the client code can use to produce different types of UI elements. Concrete factories correspond to specific operating systems and create the UI elements that match that particular OS. It works like this: when an application launches, it checks the type of the current operating system. The app uses this information to create a factory object from a class that matches the operating system. The rest of the code uses this factory to create UI elements. This prevents the wrong elements from being created. With this approach, the client code doesn’t depend on concrete classes of factories and UI elements as long as it works with these objects via their abstract interfaces. This also lets the client code support other factories or UI elements that you might add in the future. As a result, you don’t need to modify the client code each time you add a new variation of UI elements to your app. You just have to create a new factory class that produces these elements and slightly modify the app’s initialization code so it selects that class when appropriate. // The abstract factory interface declares a set of methods that // return different abstract products.

Great news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the Truck class. Adding Ships into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again. As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the app’s behavior depending on the class of transportation objects.", "solution": "Solution The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products. Subclasses can alter the class of objects being returned by the factory method. At first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method. There’s a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface. All products must follow the same interface. For example, both Truck and Ship classes should implement the Transport interface, which declares a method called deliver . Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the RoadLogistics class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the SeaLogistics class returns ships. As long as all product classes implement a common interface, you can pass their objects to the client code without breaking it. The code that uses the factory method (often called the client code) doesn’t see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses.

Concrete Products are different implementations of the product interface. The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. It’s important that the return type of this method matches the product interface. You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type. Note, despite its name, product creation is not the primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some core business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function of the company as a whole is still writing code, not producing programmers. Concrete Creators override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product. Note that the factory method doesn’t have to create new instances all the time.

The cross-platform dialog example. The base Dialog class uses different UI elements to render its window. Under various operating systems, these elements may look a little bit different, but they should still behave consistently. A button in Windows is still a button in Linux. When the factory method comes into play, you don’t need to rewrite the logic of the Dialog class for each operating system. If we declare a factory method that produces buttons inside the base Dialog class, we can later create a subclass that returns Windows-styled buttons from the factory method. The subclass then inherits most of the code from the base class, but, thanks to the factory method, can render Windows-looking buttons on the screen. For this pattern to work, the base Dialog class must work with abstract buttons: a base class or an interface that all concrete buttons follow. This way the code within Dialog remains functional, whichever type of buttons it works with. Of course, you can apply this approach to other UI elements as well. However, with each new factory method you add to the Dialog , you get closer to the Abstract Factory pattern.

The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code. For example, to add a new product type to the app, you’ll only need to create a new creator subclass and override the factory method in it. Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components. Inheritance is probably the easiest way to extend the default behavior of a library or framework. But how would the framework recognize that your subclass should be used instead of a standard component? The solution is to reduce the code that constructs components across the framework into a single factory method and let anyone override this method in addition to extending the component itself. Let’s see how that would work. Imagine that you write an app using an open source UI framework. Your app should have round buttons, but the framework only provides square ones. You extend the standard Button class with a glorious RoundButton subclass. But now you need to tell the main UIFramework class to use the new button subclass instead of a default one. To achieve this, you create a subclass UIWithRoundButtons from a base framework class and override its createButton method. While this method returns Button objects in the base class, you make your subclass return RoundButton objects. Now use the UIWithRoundButtons class instead of UIFramework . And that’s about it! Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time. You often experience this need when dealing with large, resource-intensive objects such as database connections, file systems, and network resources. Let’s think about what has to be done to reuse an existing object: First, you need to create some storage to keep track of all of the created objects. When someone requests an object, the program should look for a free object inside that pool. … and then return it to the client code. If there are no free objects, the program should create a new one (and add it to the pool). That’s a lot of code! And it must all be put into a single place so that you don’t pollute the program with duplicate code. Probably the most obvious and convenient place where this code could be placed is the constructor of the class whose objects we’re trying to reuse. However, a constructor must always return new objects by definition. It can’t return existing instances. Therefore, you need to have a regular method capable of creating new objects as well as reusing existing ones.

{"name": "Visitor", "url": "https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor", "category": "Behavioral patterns", "intent": "Intent Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.", "problem": "Problem Imagine that your team develops an app which works with geographic information structured as one colossal graph. Each node of the graph may represent a complex entity such as a city, but also more granular things like industries, sightseeing areas, etc. The nodes are connected with others if there’s a road between the real objects that they represent. Under the hood, each node type is represented by its own class, while each specific node is an object. Exporting the graph into XML. At some point, you got a task to implement exporting the graph into XML format. At first, the job seemed pretty straightforward. You planned to add an export method to each node class and then leverage recursion to go over each node of the graph, executing the export method. The solution was simple and elegant: thanks to polymorphism, you weren’t coupling the code which called the export method to concrete classes of nodes. Unfortunately, the system architect refused to allow you to alter existing node classes. He said that the code was already in production and he didn’t want to risk breaking it because of a potential bug in your changes. The XML export method had to be added into all node classes, which bore the risk of breaking the whole application if any bugs slipped through along with the change. Besides, he questioned whether it makes sense to have the XML export code within the node classes. The primary job of these classes was to work with geodata. The XML export behavior would look alien there. There was another reason for the refusal. It was highly likely that after this feature was implemented, someone from the marketing department would ask you to provide the ability to export into a different format, or request some other weird stuff. This would force you to change those precious and fragile classes again.", "solution": "Solution The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called visitor , instead of trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to one of the visitor’s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within the object. Now, what if that behavior can be executed over objects of different classes? For example, in our case with XML export, the actual implementation will probably be a little bit different across various node classes. Thus, the visitor class may define not one, but a set of methods, each of which could take arguments of different types, like this: class ExportVisitor implements Visitor is method doForCity(City c) { ... } method doForIndustry(Industry f) { ... } method doForSightSeeing(SightSeeing ss) { ... } // ... But how exactly would we call these methods, especially when dealing with the whole graph? These methods have different signatures, so we can’t use polymorphism. To pick a proper visitor method that’s able to process a given object, we’d need to check its class. Doesn’t this sound like a nightmare? foreach (Node node in graph) if (node instanceof City) exportVisitor.doForCity((City) node) if (node instanceof Industry) exportVisitor.doForIndustry((Industry) node) // ... } You might ask, why don’t we use method overloading? That’s when you give all methods the same name, even if they support different sets of parameters. Unfortunately, even assuming that our programming language supports it at all (as Java and C# do), it won’t help us. Since the exact class of a node object is unknown in advance, the overloading mechanism won’t be able to determine the correct method to execute. It’ll default to the method that takes an object of the base Node class. However, the Visitor pattern addresses this problem. It uses a technique called Double Dispatch , which helps to execute the proper method on an object without cumbersome conditionals. Instead of letting the client select a proper version of the method to call, how about we delegate this choice to objects we’re passing to the visitor as an argument? Since the objects know their own classes, they’ll be able to pick a proper method on the visitor less awkwardly. They “accept” a visitor and tell it what visiting method should be executed. // Client code foreach (Node node in graph) node.accept(exportVisitor) // City class City is method accept(Visitor v) is v.doForCity(this) // ... // Industry class Industry is method accept(Visitor v) is v.doForIndustry(this) // ... I confess. We had to change the node classes after all. But at least the change is trivial and it lets us add further behaviors without altering the code once again. Now, if we extract a common interface for all visitors, all existing nodes can work with any visitor you introduce into the app. If you find yourself introducing a new behavior related to nodes, all you have to do is implement a new visitor class.", "structure_text": "The Visitor interface declares a set of visiting methods that can take concrete elements of an object structure as arguments. These methods may have the same names if the program is written in a language that supports overloading, but the type of their parameters must be different. Each Concrete Visitor implements several versions of the same behaviors, tailored for different concrete element classes. The Element interface declares a method for “accepting” visitors. This method should have one parameter declared with the type of the visitor interface. Each Concrete Element must implement the acceptance method. The purpose of this method is to redirect the call to the proper visitor’s method corresponding to the current element class. Be aware that even if a base element class implements this method, all subclasses must still override this method in their own classes and call the appropriate method on the visitor object.

The steps may either be abstract , or have some default implementation. To use the algorithm, the client is supposed to provide its own subclass, implement all abstract steps, and override some of the optional ones if needed (but not the template method itself). Let’s see how this will play out in our data mining app. We can create a base class for all three parsing algorithms. This class defines a template method consisting of a series of calls to various document-processing steps. Template method breaks the algorithm into steps, allowing subclasses to override these steps but not the actual method. At first, we can declare all steps abstract , forcing the subclasses to provide their own implementations for these methods. In our case, subclasses already have all necessary implementations, so the only thing we might need to do is adjust signatures of the methods to match the methods of the superclass. Now, let’s see what we can do to get rid of the duplicate code. It looks like the code for opening/closing files and extracting/parsing data is different for various data formats, so there’s no point in touching those methods. However, implementation of other steps, such as analyzing the raw data and composing reports, is very similar, so it can be pulled up into the base class, where subclasses can share that code.

{"name": "State", "url": "https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state", "category": "Behavioral patterns", "intent": "Intent State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.", "problem": "Problem The State pattern is closely related to the concept of a Finite-State Machine Finite-State Machine: https://refactoring.guru/fsm . Finite-State Machine. The main idea is that, at any given moment, there’s a finite number of states which a program can be in. Within any unique state, the program behaves differently, and the program can be switched from one state to another instantaneously. However, depending on a current state, the program may or may not switch to certain other states. These switching rules, called transitions , are also finite and predetermined. You can also apply this approach to objects. Imagine that we have a Document class. A document can be in one of three states: Draft , Moderation and Published . The publish method of the document works a little bit differently in each state: In Draft , it moves the document to moderation. In Moderation , it makes the document public, but only if the current user is an administrator. In Published , it doesn’t do anything at all. Possible states and transitions of a document object. State machines are usually implemented with lots of conditional statements ( if or switch ) that select the appropriate behavior depending on the current state of the object. Usually, this “state” is just a set of values of the object’s fields. Even if you’ve never heard about finite-state machines before, you’ve probably implemented a state at least once. Does the following code structure ring a bell? class Document is field state: string // ... method publish() is switch (state) \"draft\": state = \"moderation\" break \"moderation\": if (currentUser.role == \"admin\") state = \"published\" break \"published\": // Do nothing. break // ... The biggest weakness of a state machine based on conditionals reveals itself once we start adding more and more states and state-dependent behaviors to the Document class. Most methods will contain monstrous conditionals that pick the proper behavior of a method according to the current state. Code like this is very difficult to maintain because any change to the transition logic may require changing state conditionals in every method. The problem tends to get bigger as a project evolves. It’s quite difficult to predict all possible states and transitions at the design stage. Hence, a lean state machine built with a limited set of conditionals can grow into a bloated mess over time.", "solution": "Solution The State pattern suggests that you create new classes for all possible states of an object and extract all state-specific behaviors into these classes. Instead of implementing all behaviors on its own, the original object, called context , stores a reference to one of the state objects that represents its current state, and delegates all the state-related work to that object. Document delegates the work to a state object. To transition the context into another state, replace the active state object with another object that represents that new state. This is possible only if all state classes follow the same interface and the context itself works with these objects through that interface. This structure may look similar to the Strategy pattern, but there’s one key difference. In the State pattern, the particular states may be aware of each other and initiate transitions from one state to another, whereas strategies almost never know about each other.", "structure_text": "Context stores a reference to one of the concrete state objects and delegates to it all state-specific work. The context communicates with the state object via the state interface. The context exposes a setter for passing it a new state object. The State interface declares the state-specific methods. These methods should make sense for all concrete states because you don’t want some of your states to have useless methods that will never be called. Concrete States provide their own implementations for the state-specific methods. To avoid duplication of similar code across multiple states, you may provide intermediate abstract classes that encapsulate some common behavior. State objects may store a backreference to the context object. Through this reference, the state can fetch any required info from the context object, as well as initiate state transitions.

All other objects that want to track changes to the publisher’s state are called subscribers . The Observer pattern suggests that you add a subscription mechanism to the publisher class so individual objects can subscribe to or unsubscribe from a stream of events coming from that publisher. Fear not! Everything isn’t as complicated as it sounds. In reality, this mechanism consists of 1) an array field for storing a list of references to subscriber objects and 2) several public methods which allow adding subscribers to and removing them from that list. A subscription mechanism lets individual objects subscribe to event notifications. Now, whenever an important event happens to the publisher, it goes over its subscribers and calls the specific notification method on their objects. Real apps might have dozens of different subscriber classes that are interested in tracking events of the same publisher class. You wouldn’t want to couple the publisher to all of those classes. Besides, you might not even know about some of them beforehand if your publisher class is supposed to be used by other people. That’s why it’s crucial that all subscribers implement the same interface and that the publisher communicates with them only via that interface. This interface should declare the notification method along with a set of parameters that the publisher can use to pass some contextual data along with the notification. Publisher notifies subscribers by calling the specific notification method on their objects. If your app has several different types of publishers and you want to make your subscribers compatible with all of them, you can go even further and make all publishers follow the same interface. This interface would only need to describe a few subscription methods. The interface would allow subscribers to observe publishers’ states without coupling to their concrete classes.", "structure_text": "The Publisher issues events of interest to other objects. These events occur when the publisher changes its state or executes some behaviors. Publishers contain a subscription infrastructure that lets new subscribers join and current subscribers leave the list. When a new event happens, the publisher goes over the subscription list and calls the notification method declared in the subscriber interface on each subscriber object. The Subscriber interface declares the notification interface. In most cases, it consists of a single update method. The method may have several parameters that let the publisher pass some event details along with the update. Concrete Subscribers perform some actions in response to notifications issued by the publisher. All of these classes must implement the same interface so the publisher isn’t coupled to concrete classes. Usually, subscribers need some contextual information to handle the update correctly. For this reason, publishers often pass some context data as arguments of the notification method. The publisher can pass itself as an argument, letting subscriber fetch any required data directly.

This feature has become so common over the years that nowadays people expect every app to have it. For the implementation, you chose to take the direct approach. Before performing any operation, the app records the state of all objects and saves it in some storage. Later, when a user decides to revert an action, the app fetches the latest snapshot from the history and uses it to restore the state of all objects. Before executing an operation, the app saves a snapshot of the objects’ state, which can later be used to restore objects to their previous state. Let’s think about those state snapshots. How exactly would you produce one? You’d probably need to go over all the fields in an object and copy their values into storage. However, this would only work if the object had quite relaxed access restrictions to its contents. Unfortunately, most real objects won’t let others peek inside them that easily, hiding all significant data in private fields. Ignore that problem for now and let’s assume that our objects behave like hippies: preferring open relations and keeping their state public. While this approach would solve the immediate problem and let you produce snapshots of objects’ states at will, it still has some serious issues. In the future, you might decide to refactor some of the editor classes, or add or remove some of the fields. Sounds easy, but this would also require changing the classes responsible for copying the state of the affected objects. How to make a copy of the object’s private state? But there’s more. Let’s consider the actual “snapshots” of the editor’s state. What data does it contain? At a bare minimum, it must contain the actual text, cursor coordinates, current scroll position, etc. To make a snapshot, you’d need to collect these values and put them into some kind of container. Most likely, you’re going to store lots of these container objects inside some list that would represent the history. Therefore the containers would probably end up being objects of one class. The class would have almost no methods, but lots of fields that mirror the editor’s state. To allow other objects to write and read data to and from a snapshot, you’d probably need to make its fields public. That would expose all the editor’s states, private or not. Other classes would become dependent on every little change to the snapshot class, which would otherwise happen within private fields and methods without affecting outer classes. It looks like we’ve reached a dead end: you either expose all internal details of classes, making them too fragile, or restrict access to their state, making it impossible to produce snapshots. Is there any other way to implement the \"undo\"?", "solution": "Solution All problems that we’ve just experienced are caused by broken encapsulation. Some objects try to do more than they are supposed to. To collect the data required to perform some action, they invade the private space of other objects instead of letting these objects perform the actual action. The Memento pattern delegates creating the state snapshots to the actual owner of that state, the originator object. Hence, instead of other objects trying to copy the editor’s state from the “outside,” the editor class itself can make the snapshot since it has full access to its own state. The pattern suggests storing the copy of the object’s state in a special object called memento . The contents of the memento aren’t accessible to any other object except the one that produced it. Other objects must communicate with mementos using a limited interface which may allow fetching the snapshot’s metadata (creation time, the name of the performed operation, etc.), but not the original object’s state contained in the snapshot. The originator has full access to the memento, whereas the caretaker can only access the metadata. Such a restrictive policy lets you store mementos inside other objects, usually called caretakers . Since the caretaker works with the memento only via the limited interface, it’s not able to tamper with the state stored inside the memento. At the same time, the originator has access to all fields inside the memento, allowing it to restore its previous state at will. In our text editor example, we can create a separate history class to act as the caretaker. A stack of mementos stored inside the caretaker will grow each time the editor is about to execute an operation. You could even render this stack within the app’s UI, displaying the history of previously performed operations to a user. When a user triggers the undo, the history grabs the most recent memento from the stack and passes it back to the editor, requesting a roll-back. Since the editor has full access to the memento, it changes its own state with the values taken from the memento.", "structure_text": "Implementation based on nested classes The classic implementation of the pattern relies on support for nested classes, available in many popular programming languages (such as C++, C#, and Java). The Originator class can produce snapshots of its own state, as well as restore its state from snapshots when needed. The Memento is a value object that acts as a snapshot of the originator’s state. It’s a common practice to make the memento immutable and pass it the data only once, via the constructor. The Caretaker knows not only “when” and “why” to capture the originator’s state, but also when the state should be restored. A caretaker can keep track of the originator’s history by storing a stack of mementos. When the originator has to travel back in history, the caretaker fetches the topmost memento from the stack and passes it to the originator’s restoration method. In this implementation, the memento class is nested inside the originator. This lets the originator access the fields and methods of the memento, even though they’re declared private. On the other hand, the caretaker has very limited access to the memento’s fields and methods, which lets it store mementos in a stack but not tamper with their state. Implementation based on an intermediate interface There’s an alternative implementation, suitable for programming languages that don’t support nested classes (yeah, PHP, I’m talking about you). In the absence of nested classes, you can restrict access to the memento’s fields by establishing a convention that caretakers can work with a memento only through an explicitly declared intermediary interface, which would only declare methods related to the memento’s metadata. On the other hand, originators can work with a memento object directly, accessing fields and methods declared in the memento class. The downside of this approach is that you need to declare all members of the memento public. Implementation with even stricter encapsulation There’s another implementation which is useful when you don’t want to leave even the slightest chance of other classes accessing the state of the originator through the memento. This implementation allows having multiple types of originators and mementos. Each originator works with a corresponding memento class. Neither originators nor mementos expose their state to anyone. Caretakers are now explicitly restricted from changing the state stored in mementos. Moreover, the caretaker class becomes independent from the originator because the restoration method is now defined in the memento class. Each memento becomes linked to the originator that produced it. The originator passes itself to the memento’s constructor, along with the values of its state. Thanks to the close relationship between these classes, a memento can restore the state of its originator, given that the latter has defined the appropriate setters. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 1780px; } .memento-classic { height: 440px; } .memento-empty-interface { height: 350px; } .memento-safe { height: 370px; } .struct-image1 { left: 40px; top: 290px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 160px; width: 230px; } .struct-li2 { left: 270px; top: 160px; width: 340px; } .struct-li3 { left: 640px; top: 260px; width: 210px; } .struct-li4 { left: 10px; top: 450px; width: 400px; } .struct-image2 { left: 120px; top: 780px; width: 560px; height: 350px; } .struct-li5 { left: 0px; top: 770px; width: 330px; } .struct-li6 { left: 550px; top: 930px; width: 250px; } .struct-image3 { left: 10px; top: 1440px; width: 590px; height: 340px; } .struct-li7 { left: 0px; top: 1320px; width: 370px; } .struct-li8 { left: 440px; top: 1320px; width: 380px; } .struct-li9 { left: 510px; top: 1590px; width: 330px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode This example uses the Memento pattern alongside the Command pattern for storing snapshots of the complex text editor’s state and restoring an earlier state from these snapshots when needed.

The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.", "problem": "Problem Say you have a dialog for creating and editing customer profiles. It consists of various form controls such as text fields, checkboxes, buttons, etc. Relations between elements of the user interface can become chaotic as the application evolves. Some of the form elements may interact with others. For instance, selecting the “I have a dog” checkbox may reveal a hidden text field for entering the dog’s name. Another example is the submit button that has to validate values of all fields before saving the data. Elements can have lots of relations with other elements. Hence, changes to some elements may affect the others. By having this logic implemented directly inside the code of the form elements you make these elements’ classes much harder to reuse in other forms of the app. For example, you won’t be able to use that checkbox class inside another form, because it’s coupled to the dog’s text field. You can use either all the classes involved in rendering the profile form, or none at all.", "solution": "Solution The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication between the components which you want to make independent of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues. In our example with the profile editing form, the dialog class itself may act as the mediator. Most likely, the dialog class is already aware of all of its sub-elements, so you won’t even need to introduce new dependencies into this class. UI elements should communicate indirectly, via the mediator object. The most significant change happens to the actual form elements. Let’s consider the submit button. Previously, each time a user clicked the button, it had to validate the values of all individual form elements. Now its single job is to notify the dialog about the click. Upon receiving this notification, the dialog itself performs the validations or passes the task to the individual elements. Thus, instead of being tied to a dozen form elements, the button is only dependent on the dialog class. You can go further and make the dependency even looser by extracting the common interface for all types of dialogs. The interface would declare the notification method which all form elements can use to notify the dialog about events happening to those elements. Thus, our submit button should now be able to work with any dialog that implements that interface. This way, the Mediator pattern lets you encapsulate a complex web of relations between various objects inside a single mediator object. The fewer dependencies a class has, the easier it becomes to modify, extend or reuse that class.", "structure_text": "Components are various classes that contain some business logic. Each component has a reference to a mediator, declared with the type of the mediator interface. The component isn’t aware of the actual class of the mediator, so you can reuse the component in other programs by linking it to a different mediator. The Mediator interface declares methods of communication with components, which usually include just a single notification method. Components may pass any context as arguments of this method, including their own objects, but only in such a way that no coupling occurs between a receiving component and the sender’s class. Concrete Mediators encapsulate relations between various components. Concrete mediators often keep references to all components they manage and sometimes even manage their lifecycle. Components must not be aware of other components. If something important happens within or to a component, it must only notify the mediator. When the mediator receives the notification, it can easily identify the sender, which might be just enough to decide what component should be triggered in return. From a component’s perspective, it all looks like a total black box. The sender doesn’t know who’ll end up handling its request, and the receiver doesn’t know who sent the request in the first place. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 620px; } .struct-image1 { left: 280px; top: 170px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 20px; width: 270px; } .struct-li2 { left: 300px; top: 20px; width: 480px; } .struct-li3 { left: 640px; top: 480px; width: 220px; } .struct-li4 { left: 0px; top: 260px; width: 270px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode In this example, the Mediator pattern helps you eliminate mutual dependencies between various UI classes: buttons, checkboxes and text labels.

Nonetheless, a collection is just a container for a group of objects. Various types of collections. Most collections store their elements in simple lists. However, some of them are based on stacks, trees, graphs and other complex data structures. But no matter how a collection is structured, it must provide some way of accessing its elements so that other code can use these elements. There should be a way to go through each element of the collection without accessing the same elements over and over. This may sound like an easy job if you have a collection based on a list. You just loop over all of the elements. But how do you sequentially traverse elements of a complex data structure, such as a tree? For example, one day you might be just fine with depth-first traversal of a tree. Yet the next day you might require breadth-first traversal. And the next week, you might need something else, like random access to the tree elements. The same collection can be traversed in several different ways. Adding more and more traversal algorithms to the collection gradually blurs its primary responsibility, which is efficient data storage. Additionally, some algorithms might be tailored for a specific application, so including them into a generic collection class would be weird. On the other hand, the client code that’s supposed to work with various collections may not even care how they store their elements. However, since collections all provide different ways of accessing their elements, you have no option other than to couple your code to the specific collection classes.", "solution": "Solution The main idea of the Iterator pattern is to extract the traversal behavior of a collection into a separate object called an iterator . Iterators implement various traversal algorithms. Several iterator objects can traverse the same collection at the same time. In addition to implementing the algorithm itself, an iterator object encapsulates all of the traversal details, such as the current position and how many elements are left till the end. Because of this, several iterators can go through the same collection at the same time, independently of each other. Usually, iterators provide one primary method for fetching elements of the collection. The client can keep running this method until it doesn’t return anything, which means that the iterator has traversed all of the elements. All iterators must implement the same interface. This makes the client code compatible with any collection type or any traversal algorithm as long as there’s a proper iterator. If you need a special way to traverse a collection, you just create a new iterator class, without having to change the collection or the client.", "structure_text": "The Iterator interface declares the operations required for traversing a collection: fetching the next element, retrieving the current position, restarting iteration, etc. Concrete Iterators implement specific algorithms for traversing a collection. The iterator object should track the traversal progress on its own. This allows several iterators to traverse the same collection independently of each other. The Collection interface declares one or multiple methods for getting iterators compatible with the collection. Note that the return type of the methods must be declared as the iterator interface so that the concrete collections can return various kinds of iterators. Concrete Collections return new instances of a particular concrete iterator class each time the client requests one. You might be wondering, where’s the rest of the collection’s code? Don’t worry, it should be in the same class. It’s just that these details aren’t crucial to the actual pattern, so we’re omitting them. The Client works with both collections and iterators via their interfaces. This way the client isn’t coupled to concrete classes, allowing you to use various collections and iterators with the same client code. Typically, clients don’t create iterators on their own, but instead get them from collections. Yet, in certain cases, the client can create one directly; for example, when the client defines its own special iterator. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 600px; } .struct-image1 { left: 190px; top: 0px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 20px; width: 220px; } .struct-li2 { left: 0px; top: 210px; width: 180px; } .struct-li3 { left: 680px; top: 0px; width: 230px; } .struct-li4 { left: 680px; top: 250px; width: 230px; } .struct-li5 { left: 200px; top: 440px; width: 460px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode In this example, the Iterator pattern is used to walk through a special kind of collection which encapsulates access to Facebook’s social graph.

Both iterators implement a common interface which allows clients to fetch profiles without diving into implementation details such as authentication and sending REST requests.

For example, a user could click a small “Copy” button on the toolbar, or copy something via the context menu, or just hit Ctrl+C on the keyboard. Initially, when our app only had the toolbar, it was okay to place the implementation of various operations into the button subclasses. In other words, having the code for copying text inside the CopyButton subclass was fine. But then, when you implement context menus, shortcuts, and other stuff, you have to either duplicate the operation’s code in many classes or make menus dependent on buttons, which is an even worse option.", "solution": "Solution Good software design is often based on the principle of separation of concerns , which usually results in breaking an app into layers. The most common example: a layer for the graphical user interface and another layer for the business logic. The GUI layer is responsible for rendering a beautiful picture on the screen, capturing any input and showing results of what the user and the app are doing. However, when it comes to doing something important, like calculating the trajectory of the moon or composing an annual report, the GUI layer delegates the work to the underlying layer of business logic. In the code it might look like this: a GUI object calls a method of a business logic object, passing it some arguments. This process is usually described as one object sending another a request . The GUI objects may access the business logic objects directly. The Command pattern suggests that GUI objects shouldn’t send these requests directly. Instead, you should extract all of the request details, such as the object being called, the name of the method and the list of arguments into a separate command class with a single method that triggers this request. Command objects serve as links between various GUI and business logic objects. From now on, the GUI object doesn’t need to know what business logic object will receive the request and how it’ll be processed. The GUI object just triggers the command, which handles all the details. Accessing the business logic layer via a command. The next step is to make your commands implement the same interface. Usually it has just a single execution method that takes no parameters. This interface lets you use various commands with the same request sender, without coupling it to concrete classes of commands. As a bonus, now you can switch command objects linked to the sender, effectively changing the sender’s behavior at runtime. You might have noticed one missing piece of the puzzle, which is the request parameters. A GUI object might have supplied the business-layer object with some parameters. Since the command execution method doesn’t have any parameters, how would we pass the request details to the receiver? It turns out the command should be either pre-configured with this data, or capable of getting it on its own. The GUI objects delegate the work to commands. Let’s get back to our text editor. After we apply the Command pattern, we no longer need all those button subclasses to implement various click behaviors. It’s enough to put a single field into the base Button class that stores a reference to a command object and make the button execute that command on a click. You’ll implement a bunch of command classes for every possible operation and link them with particular buttons, depending on the buttons’ intended behavior. Other GUI elements, such as menus, shortcuts or entire dialogs, can be implemented in the same way. They’ll be linked to a command which gets executed when a user interacts with the GUI element. As you’ve probably guessed by now, the elements related to the same operations will be linked to the same commands, preventing any code duplication. As a result, commands become a convenient middle layer that reduces coupling between the GUI and business logic layers. And that’s only a fraction of the benefits that the Command pattern can offer!", "structure_text": "The Sender class (aka invoker ) is responsible for initiating requests. This class must have a field for storing a reference to a command object. The sender triggers that command instead of sending the request directly to the receiver. Note that the sender isn’t responsible for creating the command object. Usually, it gets a pre-created command from the client via the constructor. The Command interface usually declares just a single method for executing the command. Concrete Commands implement various kinds of requests. A concrete command isn’t supposed to perform the work on its own, but rather to pass the call to one of the business logic objects. However, for the sake of simplifying the code, these classes can be merged. Parameters required to execute a method on a receiving object can be declared as fields in the concrete command. You can make command objects immutable by only allowing the initialization of these fields via the constructor. The Receiver class contains some business logic. Almost any object may act as a receiver. Most commands only handle the details of how a request is passed to the receiver, while the receiver itself does the actual work. The Client creates and configures concrete command objects. The client must pass all of the request parameters, including a receiver instance, into the command’s constructor. After that, the resulting command may be associated with one or multiple senders. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 620px; } .struct-image1 { left: 40px; top: 150px; } .struct-li1 { left: 50px; top: 10px; width: 510px; } .struct-li2 { left: 600px; top: 70px; width: 220px; } .struct-li3 { left: 680px; top: 190px; width: 220px; } .struct-li4 { left: 180px; top: 530px; width: 480px; } .struct-li5 { left: 0px; top: 230px; width: 160px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode In this example, the Command pattern helps to track the history of executed operations and makes it possible to revert an operation if needed. Undoable operations in a text editor. Commands which result in changing the state of the editor (e.g., cutting and pasting) make a backup copy of the editor’s state before executing an operation associated with the command. After a command is executed, it’s placed into the command history (a stack of command objects) along with the backup copy of the editor’s state at that point. Later, if the user needs to revert an operation, the app can take the most recent command from the history, read the associated backup of the editor’s state, and restore it. The client code (GUI elements, command history, etc.) isn’t coupled to concrete command classes because it works with commands via the command interface.

The Command pattern can turn a specific method call into a stand-alone object. This change opens up a lot of interesting uses: you can pass commands as method arguments, store them inside other objects, switch linked commands at runtime, etc. Here’s an example: you’re developing a GUI component such as a context menu, and you want your users to be able to configure menu items that trigger operations when an end user clicks an item. Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule their execution, or execute them remotely. As with any other object, a command can be serialized, which means converting it to a string that can be easily written to a file or a database. Later, the string can be restored as the initial command object. Thus, you can delay and schedule command execution. But there’s even more! In the same way, you can queue, log or send commands over the network. Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible operations. Although there are many ways to implement undo/redo, the Command pattern is perhaps the most popular of all. To be able to revert operations, you need to implement the history of performed operations. The command history is a stack that contains all executed command objects along with related backups of the application’s state. This method has two drawbacks. First, it isn’t that easy to save an application’s state because some of it can be private. This problem can be mitigated with the Memento pattern. Second, the state backups may consume quite a lot of RAM. Therefore, sometimes you can resort to an alternative implementation: instead of restoring the past state, the command performs the inverse operation.

{"name": "Chain of Responsibility", "url": "https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility", "category": "Behavioral patterns", "intent": "Intent Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.", "problem": "Problem Imagine that you’re working on an online ordering system. You want to restrict access to the system so only authenticated users can create orders. Also, users who have administrative permissions must have full access to all orders. After a bit of planning, you realized that these checks must be performed sequentially. The application can attempt to authenticate a user to the system whenever it receives a request that contains the user’s credentials. However, if those credentials aren’t correct and authentication fails, there’s no reason to proceed with any other checks. The request must pass a series of checks before the ordering system itself can handle it. During the next few months, you implemented several more of those sequential checks. One of your colleagues suggested that it’s unsafe to pass raw data straight to the ordering system. So you added an extra validation step to sanitize the data in a request. Later, somebody noticed that the system is vulnerable to brute force password cracking. To negate this, you promptly added a check that filters repeated failed requests coming from the same IP address. Someone else suggested that you could speed up the system by returning cached results on repeated requests containing the same data. Hence, you added another check which lets the request pass through to the system only if there’s no suitable cached response. The bigger the code grew, the messier it became. The code of the checks, which had already looked like a mess, became more and more bloated as you added each new feature. Changing one check sometimes affected the others. Worst of all, when you tried to reuse the checks to protect other components of the system, you had to duplicate some of the code since those components required some of the checks, but not all of them. The system became very hard to comprehend and expensive to maintain. You struggled with the code for a while, until one day you decided to refactor the whole thing.", "solution": "Solution Like many other behavioral design patterns, the Chain of Responsibility relies on transforming particular behaviors into stand-alone objects called handlers . In our case, each check should be extracted to its own class with a single method that performs the check. The request, along with its data, is passed to this method as an argument. The pattern suggests that you link these handlers into a chain. Each linked handler has a field for storing a reference to the next handler in the chain. In addition to processing a request, handlers pass the request further along the chain. The request travels along the chain until all handlers have had a chance to process it. Here’s the best part: a handler can decide not to pass the request further down the chain and effectively stop any further processing. In our example with ordering systems, a handler performs the processing and then decides whether to pass the request further down the chain. Assuming the request contains the right data, all the handlers can execute their primary behavior, whether it’s authentication checks or caching. Handlers are lined up one by one, forming a chain. However, there’s a slightly different approach (and it’s a bit more canonical) in which, upon receiving a request, a handler decides whether it can process it. If it can, it doesn’t pass the request any further. So it’s either only one handler that processes the request or none at all. This approach is very common when dealing with events in stacks of elements within a graphical user interface. For instance, when a user clicks a button, the event propagates through the chain of GUI elements that starts with the button, goes along its containers (like forms or panels), and ends up with the main application window. The event is processed by the first element in the chain that’s capable of handling it. This example is also noteworthy because it shows that a chain can always be extracted from an object tree. A chain can be formed from a branch of an object tree. It’s crucial that all handler classes implement the same interface. Each concrete handler should only care about the following one having the execute method. This way you can compose chains at runtime, using various handlers without coupling your code to their concrete classes.", "structure_text": "The Handler declares the interface, common for all concrete handlers. It usually contains just a single method for handling requests, but sometimes it may also have another method for setting the next handler on the chain. The Base Handler is an optional class where you can put the boilerplate code that’s common to all handler classes. Usually, this class defines a field for storing a reference to the next handler. The clients can build a chain by passing a handler to the constructor or setter of the previous handler. The class may also implement the default handling behavior: it can pass execution to the next handler after checking for its existence. Concrete Handlers contain the actual code for processing requests. Upon receiving a request, each handler must decide whether to process it and, additionally, whether to pass it along the chain. Handlers are usually self-contained and immutable, accepting all necessary data just once via the constructor. The Client may compose chains just once or compose them dynamically, depending on the application’s logic. Note that a request can be sent to any handler in the chain—it doesn’t have to be the first one. @media (min-width: 1200px) { .structure { margin: 0; width: auto; height: 450px; } .struct-image1 { left: 280px; top: 50px; } .struct-li1 { left: 0px; top: 10px; width: 280px; } .struct-li2 { left: 0px; top: 180px; width: 280px; } .struct-li4 { left: 670px; top: -10px; width: 230px; } .struct-li3 { left: 670px; top: 180px; width: 230px; } }", "pseudocode": "Pseudocode In this example, the Chain of Responsibility pattern is responsible for displaying contextual help information for active GUI elements. The GUI classes are built with the Composite pattern. Each element is linked to its container element. At any point, you can build a chain of elements that starts with the element itself and goes through all of its container elements. The application’s GUI is usually structured as an object tree. For example, the Dialog class, which renders the main window of the app, would be the root of the object tree. The dialog contains Panels , which might contain other panels or simple low-level elements like Buttons and TextFields . A simple component can show brief contextual tooltips, as long as the component has some help text assigned. But more complex components define their own way of showing contextual help, such as showing an excerpt from the manual or opening a page in a browser. That’s how a help request traverses GUI objects. When a user points the mouse cursor at an element and presses the F1 key, the application detects the component under the pointer and sends it a help request. The request bubbles up through all the element’s containers until it reaches the element that’s capable of displaying the help information. // The handler interface declares a method for executing a // request. interface ComponentWithContextualHelp is method showHelp() // The base class for simple components. abstract class Component implements ComponentWithContextualHelp is field tooltipText: string // The component's container acts as the next link in the // chain of handlers. protected field container: Container // The component shows a tooltip if there's help text // assigned to it.
